## Python and packages.
First, download this project using the Code > Download ZIP and extract the ZIP.

This code is written in python, so you need it to run the code. I recommend installing [Python 3.11 from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NRWMJP3717K), because that's what i used to write it.

After installing python, you have to **install the packages** using the pip install command.
Do the command `pip3 install minestat discord` to install the needed packages.
